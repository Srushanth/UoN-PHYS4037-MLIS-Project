# Project 1: Deep Learning Network for Fatigue Monitoring of Wind Turbine Blades
Neil Kemp (ppznk@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk)

- Monitoring the condition of wind turbines
    - What is monitored?
        - $\textcolor{green}{\text{Fatigue and aging in wind turbine blades}}$
    - What types of sensors being used?
    - At what frequency the data is collected?
    - How the blades of the turbine are monitored?
    - How effects of their installation is monitored?
    - How operation on marine life is monitored?
- Offshore wind turbines are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, including changing humidity, air pressure and temperature, as well as unpredictable loads.
    - What are the effects of the above on the installed sensors?
    - How do we know the data we are getting is accurate despite of all the above effects?
- The objective of this project will be to develop a suitable **_Machine Learning system_** for **_monitoring fatigue and aging_** in wind turbine blades.
    - Where can I find more information on this?

# Project 4: Mapping Sites Associated with Slavery from Space
Dr Maggie Lieu (maggie.lieu@nottingham.ac.uk)

> Important

    > The scope of this project remains open-ended
    > Explore new methods to improve upon the existing object detection pipeline, ideally with an end-to-end model
    > Distinguish between active and abandoned kilns, and identifying the sensitivities and biases

- How to detect forced labour? Are there any existing methods known?
- Are there any existing datasets?
    - If yes, is it labelled?
- Is there any labelled data with active and abandoned kilns?
